## BUGS
- dont allow the same avatar to be picked by multiple players
- i am able to join a room that doesnt exist
- player gets diconnected on screen close
- long username truncated
- play again is starting a new game
- +15 button padding
- if there are no players, game should end or something
- Setting up game room in the beginning
- Player avatars not centered within the circles on the leadarboard

IF There is a big issue with the height, add back the min-h-screen class to the relevant divs in host-game-layout.tsx


## ENHANCEMENTS
- allow user to choose another avatar?
- when restarting a game, take back to qr lobby with the same room code
- standardize the buttons and progress bars
- rebus and trivia should have diff rooms?
- home page header
- Handle room lifecycle events better
    - if host disconnects, end the game for everyone
    - if a user disconnects, show a message to the host (maybe pause the game?)


## FEATURES
- connect to rebus db 
- repick an avatar
- player extra time request (later)
    - add an option to request for an extra 15 seconds on the player view
    - if everyone requests it, add 15 seconds to the timer. 
    - show a small counter of how many people have requested extra time on the host view.
- game pause
    - add a text on player view like "host is upto something..."
- sound effects
    - ticking sound during last 5 seconds
    - sound when time is up
    - sound when answer is submitted
- host needs an account
    - to purchase packs later on

- Let players emote during the game
    - thumbs up, clap, laugh, etc.
    - show a small animation on the player view when an emote is sent
    - limit the number of emotes per game to avoid spam

- Skeleton
- Use Shadcn UI's Skeleton component to show loading states
- Show loading sign on the main screen before launching the game

## Code improvements
- Add types all across the app
- Custom components for buttons, modals, etc. to avoid code duplication

## Larger ideas
- Users should be able to create their own trivia questions and submit it to a database. We should then be able to review and add it to the game packs.
- They should get rewarded with some in-app currency for every approved submission.


## Game flow improvements
Rejoining
- allow players to rejoin if they get disconnected. We need to keep track of players by their unique ids and allow them to rejoin the game in progress, and restore their state (score, avatar, etc.)
- Show the player a message if they get disconnected. Show a reconnect button that tries to reconnect them to the game. Reconnection: Allow a connection only if the cookie or deviceId matches a player already in the list (handling disconnects).
- (Maybe) Explicit End: Host clicks "End Game" -> Delete key from Redis immediately.

## Room Code Management
- Room code Uniqueness: Ensure generated room codes are unique and not currently in use.
- Room code Sanitization: Remove ambiguous characters if you use numbers (e.g., remove 'I', '1', '0', 'O').
- Also avoid offensive words in room codes.
- Heartbeats: As long as the Host is connected via WebSocket, send a "heartbeat" every minute to reset the TTL to 1 hour. This ensures active rooms stay open, but if the Host crashes or closes the tab, the room expires automatically after an hour.


## Game end action button
- Show a recommendation marquee at the end of the game with the list of other packs available to play.
- Add another button below this to go to "Explore Game Library".
